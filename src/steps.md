In the chart to the right we see the $clubCount clubs that we looked at. 
The size of each bubble reflects the amount of RA users following that club, 
while the colour of the bubble reflects the group that it belongs to. 

The groups are calculated based on how similar the line ups for each pair of 
clubs are. If two clubs have many artists and djs in common the those two clubs 
are likely to be be in the same group<sup>1</sup>.

There were $linkCount pairs of clubs that had some overlap in their line ups. 
*$source* and *$target* have the most similar line ups, with $weight% overlap in their
bookings.

You can click on each club to see more details about it, which artists featured 
on their line up most often and which other clubs are similar to it.

except Berghain / Panorama bar.
